# ML-Based-Surrogate-LUTO-Model-V1

Model is Developed by Md Shakil Kha as a work relating to the PhD work in Deakin University.

The dataset are produced by Processed based LUTO Model developed by Deakin University and CSIRO

Python notebooks are used to develop and train the Machine Learning Based LUTO Model.

.sav files are trained model for individual outputs.
.csv file is used to train the mode and the notebook can be used to reproduce the work.
